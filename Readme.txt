In this project I work on my Excel skills by pretending to be a programmer.  I use VBA scripting to analyze real stock market data. 

Instructions:

The script I have created loops through all the stocks for one year and output the following information.
	
- The ticker symbol.
- Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
- The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
- The total stock volume of the stock.
- I used conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.
- My solution has also returned the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease" and "Greatest total volume".
